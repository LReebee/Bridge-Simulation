1st: Adding the structure (Bridge) and objects.
2nd: Adding the functions for both the drop of the objects and the collision for the strucutre to stop the drop.
3rd: Adding the function that makes the drop react (Idk if it should become wider per weight increase or become shorter per weight increase)
4th: Adding Reset button, Save button, and spawn obejcts button.
5th: Make it work :D
6th (Optional): If everthing works then we add a UI that shows the amount of dropped objects, overall weight dropped, and the quantity of each obejcts dropped.
7th: Present it I guess?
